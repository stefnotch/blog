# Pagination

No seriously, this is an entire page all about that little pagination bar at the bottom of some websites. This little thing is much trickier than I thought.

TODO: Put pagination component here, 3 or so examples should do it

has caused me hours of thinking and staring at subtly wrong online tutorials.

## What I want
A pagination bar which
- has a maximum width
- always tries to take up the maximum width
    - exception is if there aren't enough pages
- always at least displays the first page, the current page and the last page
- shows a "..." if there are too many pages between the current page and the first/last page
- tries to show `n` neighbor pages around the current page
- is a nice Vue.js component (bonus)


## How to get there
