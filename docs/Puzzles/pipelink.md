# Pipelink!

I remember seeing this game in an Arabian newspaper, and playing it every time. I quite enjoyed it back then, _but I couldn't remember the name_.

&lt;cue glorified tales of countless struggles while I was trying to hunt it down&gt;

Finding an obscure puzzle without having a name is hard to say the least. So I was overjoyed when a lovely user by the name of qqwref from the [Puzzle Loop](https://www.puzzle-loop.com/) Discord server managed to hunt it down!

So happy that I wrote a solver for it.
